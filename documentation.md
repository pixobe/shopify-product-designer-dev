## Getting started

Follow Shopify best practices when editing themes or product settings.

### Step 1: Add the customization button to the product page

1. Open the theme editor and switch to a product template.
   Example:
   https://admin.shopify.com/store/online-coloring/themes/155391197430/editor?previewPath=%2Fproducts%2Foffice-shirt%3Fvariant%3D49810335334646
2. From the left sidebar, add a block and select "Pixobe Product Designer".
3. Place the block under the Buy Button (or wherever the customization button should appear).
4. Save the theme.
5. If the block does not appear, confirm you are editing a product template and the app block is enabled. If it still does not show up, pause and check with support before continuing.

### Step 2: Style the button

1. Select the Pixobe Product Designer block.
2. Adjust the button appearance in the block settings.
3. Save the theme.

## Enable customization for a product

1. In Shopify admin, go to Products and select the product you want to enable.
2. If this is your first time, scroll to the "Blocks" section and add or pin the "Product Editor" block for Pixobe Product Designer.
3. Open "Product Settings" from the block and enable customization.
4. Save the product.

## Verify on storefront

1. Visit the product page on your storefront.
2. Confirm the customization button appears and launches the designer.
